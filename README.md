  <strong>The flight recorder for your Claude Code and Codex sessions.</strong><br/>
  Replay every turn, see where the tokens went, and spot the sessions that went sideways — all from data already on your disk.

</p>

Marey reads the session data Claude Code already writes under `~/.claude/` (and Codex under `~/.codex/`) and turns it into a local dashboard. The data is already there. Nothing visualizes it. This does.

## Features

<tr>
<td width="40%" valign="middle">

### Session Replay

Turn-by-turn view of prompts, tool calls and file diffs (versioned via `~/.claude/file-history/`), with quality signals and a friction breakdown. Export any session as a self-contained HTML snapshot.

### Timeline

Context fill, cumulative API value and tokens per turn, with compactions, prompts and failed tool calls marked. Hover any turn for its numbers, or click a prompt marker to see the tool calls it triggered.

**Codex sessions** from the Codex CLI and IDE extension show up next to Claude Code ones, tagged `codex`, with their tokens, GPT pricing, prompts, commands, patches and timeline. A Claude Code / Codex filter appears once both have sessions.

## Install

### As a Claude Code plugin (recommended)

**1. Add the plugin.** In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add n-pizzetta/marey
/plugin install marey@marey
```

**2. Open the dashboard.** `/marey:replay` parses `~/.claude` and opens `localhost:3333`.

**3. Connect your limits** *(recommended)*. `/marey:limits` turns on the real 5h and 7-day limits and the context advice; `/marey:limits --uninstall` undoes it.

Needs Node 20+ on your `PATH`.

<details>
<summary>What <code>/marey:limits</code> changes</summary>

Claude Code only exposes your 5-hour and 7-day usage limits (the numbers behind `/usage`) to the status line, so the command installs a small wrapper that records them for the dashboard:

- Your existing status line keeps rendering unchanged, and `settings.json` is backed up first.
- It also records each live session's context fill and prompt-cache warmth, which power the *keep going / compact / clear* verdict in the session view.
- A short `ctx ━━━───── 33% │ cache warm 59m` segment is appended to your status line, colored green / yellow / red by level. Hide it with `"verdict": false` in `~/.claude/marey/statusline.json`.
- `statusLine.refreshInterval` is set to 30 seconds (unless you already set one) so the cache countdown keeps moving while the session is idle.

Without it, the dashboard still shows tokens and cost for an inferred 5h window, just not the limit percentages.

</details>

The plugin also registers a `PostToolUse` hook that records fine-grained tool sequences to `~/.claude/marey/cache/{sessionId}.jsonl`, so sessions can be replayed call by call.

### Updating

Turn on auto-update once: `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** → `marey` → **Enable auto-update** (it's off by default for marketplaces outside Anthropic's). Claude Code then fetches new versions shortly after you start a session and tells you to run `/reload-plugins`. Without auto-update: `/plugin` → **Installed** → `marey` → **Update now** (or `claude plugin update marey@marey`), then `/reload-plugins`.

Then run `/marey:replay`. If the dashboard from the previous version is still running, it is stopped and the new one takes its place, and the status line wrapper installed by `/marey:limits` is refreshed on the way: nothing to restart or re-install by hand.

### Upgrading from ccblackbox

Marey was called ccblackbox. The plugin id changed, so Claude Code won't update it by itself: remove the old plugin and add the new one.

```
/plugin uninstall ccblackbox@ccblackbox
/plugin marketplace remove ccblackbox
/plugin marketplace add n-pizzetta/marey
/plugin install marey@marey
/marey:limits
```

Your data moves on its own: the first run moves `~/.claude/ccblackbox/` (XP, badges, limits history, tool cache, model overrides) to `~/.claude/marey/` and leaves a link at the old path, so nothing breaks in between. `/marey:limits` points your status line at the new folder; your previous status line is kept. Dashboard settings saved in the browser carry over too.

### From source

Requires Node 20+ and pnpm.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/n-pizzetta/marey && cd marey
pnpm install
pnpm serve                            # parse ~/.claude/, serve on :3333 and open the browser
node scripts/serve.mjs --help         # --port, --no-open
node scripts/install-statusline.mjs   # optional: real usage limits (see above)
```

## Privacy

**Everything runs locally: no network calls, no telemetry.** Marey reads (from `~/.claude`, or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set):

| Data | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Prompts and assistant outputs | `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`, `~/.claude/history.jsonl` |
| Session metadata, tool counts, tokens, cost | `~/.claude/usage-data/` |
| Versioned snapshots of files edited via Claude Code | `~/.claude/file-history/` |
| Live session state | `~/.claude/sessions/` |
| Codex rollouts and thread names (or under `$CODEX_HOME` when set) | `~/.codex/sessions/`, `~/.codex/archived_sessions/`, `~/.codex/session_index.jsonl` |

The server only listens on `127.0.0.1` and refuses state-changing requests from other websites. The optional `pnpm parse` dump is written to `~/.claude/marey/sessions.json`, never inside the repo.

## Pricing

Costs are estimates at Anthropic's and OpenAI's public API rates (no batch or negotiated discounts; on a Pro/Max plan they are an API-equivalent value, not what you pay). The table lives in [`scripts/models.mjs`](./scripts/models.mjs) and every turn is priced with its own model.

A model missing from the table still gets a readable name and is priced like the latest model of its family. Costs that include it are marked `~` in the dashboard. To fix one without waiting for a release, add it to `~/.claude/marey/models.json` (prices in USD per million tokens; picked up on the next refresh):

```json
{
  "claude-opus-6": { "label": "Opus 6", "in": 6, "out": 30, "cacheRead": 0.6 }
}
```

Cache writes are derived from `in` (1.25x for the 5-minute TTL, 2x for 1 hour). Entries override built-in rows with the same id.

## Developing

```sh
pnpm dev          # Vite dev server with live re-parse on ~/.claude changes
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm typecheck    # tsc
pnpm build        # typecheck + build → dist/ (committed: the plugin ships it prebuilt)
pnpm test         # node --test (parser)
pnpm parse        # one-shot dump of every session to ~/.claude/marey/sessions.json
```

The dev server and `scripts/serve.mjs` mount the same API (`scripts/api.mjs`): it runs the parser in-process, keeps sessions in memory and re-parses when `~/.claude/` changes (unchanged transcripts are cached). The front-end fetches a lightweight list (`/api/sessions`) and loads each session's detail on demand (`/api/sessions/:id`). If the API is unreachable, it falls back to built-in demo data.

```
~/.claude/{projects, sessions, usage-data, file-history, history.jsonl}
                  │
                  ▼
     scripts/parse-sessions.mjs      transcripts → sessions (+ scripts/models.mjs pricing)

                  │
                  ▼ fetch
   React 19 SPA (hash routing)
   ├─ StatsStrip / SessionList / SessionFilters
   ├─ SessionDetail (Overview / Timeline / Tools / Tokens / Files)
   ├─ SessionCompare
   └─ FleetDashboard (src/components/fleet/)
```

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the parser internals, component map and build pipeline.

**Stack:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, `diff`, bundled Inter Tight / JetBrains Mono fonts. The server uses Node built-ins only.

### Known limitations

- Cold start re-parses every session (a few seconds with several hundred sessions).
- Live-session detection uses `ps`, so on Windows running sessions show as crashed. Windows is otherwise untested.
- Test coverage is thin: only the parser has tests (`pnpm test`).
- Codex sessions have no context-quality score, ghost detection, file-history diffs or `/insights` outcome (Claude Code only). They are kept out of Claude's 5h window, badges and the Claude-specific health rules, and the usage-limits pill shows Claude's limits only.
